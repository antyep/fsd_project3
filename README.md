    What is Mastermind?
</h2>

Mastermind is a board game of wit and reflection for two players. It is played on a board with small black and white tiles and other coloured tiles of a slightly larger size. One of the players chooses a number of coloured tiles, 4 in the original game, and places a secret code hidden from the other player.
